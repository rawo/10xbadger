# Application - Badger (MVP)

### Main problem
A software-house company is using a system of badges to motivate engineers to learn, develop them selves, and to be promoted to a higher possition. The badge system provides set of well defined bagdes, including description, requirements or task to fullfill in order to earn the badge. Once a specific set of badges is earned then a given engineer is eligible to be promoted. The problem is that the system is maintained in excel file containing issued badges, and confluence page containing bagde definitions. It is is very inconvienient to use and maintain.

### Minimum viabale features (MVP)
- Engineer, as Badger user, is able to issue badge for acceptance, review history of promotions, view current onging promotion, view catalog of badges, create/edit/remove badge prepared for promotion, add/remove badge to/from current ongoing promotion
- Badger administrator is able to review badges issued by engineers, accept or reject those badges, view catalog of badges, edit/add/deactive badges from the catalog
- Badger administrator is able to grant/revoke administrative priviliges for Badger users
- User (administartor, engineer) is able to search through the badge catalog 

### What is NOT in the scope of MVP
- Mobile application
- Chat-like communication
- Comments attached to badges
- History of changes for each badge
- System of likes/dislikes
- Badge propositions issued by engineers (only administrator can do that)

### Success criteria
- 90% of engineers working in the software-house is using Badger app
- 100% of engineers is using the 'issue badge for acceptance' feature

Analyze the information provided, focusing on aspects relevant to PRD creation. Consider the following questions:
<prd_analysis>
1. Identify the main problem that the product is intended to solve.
2. Define the key functionalities of the MVP.
3. Consider potential user stories and paths of product usage.
4. Think about success criteria and how to measure them.
5. Assess design constraints and their impact on product development.
6. Identify the risks and challanges.
</prd_analysis>

Based on your analysis, generate a list of 10 questions and recommendations in a combined form (question + recommendation). These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective PRD. Consider questions about:

1. Details of the user's problem
2. Prioritization of functionality
3. Expected user experience
4. Measurable success indicators
5. Potential risks and challenges
6. Schedule and resources

<questions>
List your questions and recommendations here, numbered for clarity:

For example:
1. Are you planning to introduce paid subscriptions from the start of the project?

Recommendation: The first phase of the project could focus on free features to attract users, and paid features could be introduced at a later stage.
</questions>

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the user's responses, until the user explicitly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Analytical work should be done in the thinking block. The final output should consist solely of questions and recommendations and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the prd_analysis section.
