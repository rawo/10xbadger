# AI Rules for 10xbadger

Badger is a web application designed to replace legacy Excel and Confluence-based badge tracking with a single system for cataloging badges, submitting badge applications, and building promotion submissions. The MVP focuses on core flows for engineers and administrators: catalog browsing and search, badge application drafting and submission, administrative review, promotion building and submission, and basic role-based access via Google Workspace SSO.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
